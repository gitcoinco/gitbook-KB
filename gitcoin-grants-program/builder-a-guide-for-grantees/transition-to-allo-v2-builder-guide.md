# ðŸŒ¿ Transition to Allo v2: Builder Guide

#### What is Allo v2?

Grants Stack is currently built on top of the [Allo protocol](https://docs.allo.gitcoin.co/#current-status), a set of smart contracts that enable the democratic allocation and distribution of capital, and Allo v2 is the latest version of the protocol. With the transition to Allo v2, we are excited to improve overall user experience, enable experimentation of modular and flexible funding mechanisms, and empower developers to easily contribute to the protocol to build new community funding experiences.

#### Navigating Builder on Allo v2

* You can continue to access Builder at:[ builder.gitcoin.co](http://builder.gitcoin.co). Within the app, youâ€™ll have the option to use Builder on v1 or v2, depending on your needs.
*   **When using Builder on v1, you will be able to make the following changes:**

    * Create new projects on v1
    * Edit existing projects on v1
    * Apply to rounds on v1 with v1 projects

    Note: only v1 projects can be used to apply to v1 rounds. If a grantee only has v2 projects, they will need to create a new project on v1 to apply.
*   **When using Builder on v2, they will be able to:**

    * See a migrated version of any existing v1 projects on v2, Including any existing data associated with that project
      * Note: **All existing projects on v1 will be migrated to v2 on Arbitrum** â€” grantees can use their migrated projects on Arbitrum to apply to rounds deployed on any supported chain. They do _not_ need to create new projects per chain in order to apply to a round on a chain other than Arbitrum.
    * Be able to create and edit any new projects on v2
    * Be able to apply to v2 rounds using v2 projects
