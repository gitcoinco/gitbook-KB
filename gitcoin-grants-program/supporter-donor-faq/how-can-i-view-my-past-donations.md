# üëÅÔ∏è How can I view my past donations?

On Gitcoin Explorer, you have a Donor Profile where you can see a history of all of your donations to past and current grants rounds on Grants Stack. For every donation, you have links back to the projects you donated to, the amount of your donation, and a link to your transaction on-chain. Additionally, you can also share the link of your profile publicly and view a summary of your overall donation stats. You can check out your Donor Profile today on[ Gitcoin Explorer](http://explorer.gitcoin.co/), by clicking on the Profile icon in the top right corner of the page. \
