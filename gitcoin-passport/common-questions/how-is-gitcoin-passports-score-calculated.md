The threshold for Gitcoin Passport Scoring is 20 and the maximum possible score is 100. We encourage all users to verify as many stamps as they can to increase their Passport Score but a score of 20 is sufficient.

_Note: Passport stamps will automatically expire 90 days after verification. You will need to re-verify Passport Stamps periodically._

The specific weights of all the data points are here:
