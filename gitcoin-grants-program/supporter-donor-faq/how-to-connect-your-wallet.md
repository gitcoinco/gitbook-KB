When you connect your wallet, a few pop-ups will appear to facilitate wallet connection: in the first pop-up, you'll be able to:

* Choose from a list of wallets to connect to
* Obtain a wallet if you don't have one&#x20;

If you _don't_ have a wallet, you can choose to create a wallet and connect:

If you _do_ have a wallet, you'll be able to connect your wallet by selecting it from the list.&#x20;

For example, if you hold a MetMask wallet, it'll look a bit like this:

* First, you must enter your password
