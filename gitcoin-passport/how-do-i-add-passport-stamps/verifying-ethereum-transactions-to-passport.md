## How Does it Work

The Gitcoin Passport's Ethereum stamp provides a nuanced reflection of user engagement on the Ethereum mainnet by assessing a variety of activities. This enhancement is geared towards offering a holistic view of an individual's participation within the ecosystem. The stamp categorizes users into tiered levels such as&#x20;

* ETH Enthusiast: Showcases initial engagement and support for the Ethereum ecosystem.&#x20;
* ETH Pioneer: A step higher than the Enthusiast, reflecting ongoing commitment and active participation in Ethereum's growth.&#x20;
* ETH Advocate: A much deeper commitment and participation in the Ethereum ecosystem.&#x20;
* ETH Maxi: The ultimate badge of honor, embodying full-fledged advocacy and a dominant presence in the community.

Each credential, indicating the user's activity depth on the network, has an associated score of 2.65, and the score is cumulative with each tier attained. This structured approach ensures that the stamp accurately mirrors the dynamic and evolving nature of user interaction on Ethereum.
