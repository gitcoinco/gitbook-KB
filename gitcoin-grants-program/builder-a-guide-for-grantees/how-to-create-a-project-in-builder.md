# 📰 How to create a project in Builder

There are 2 separate steps that must be taken in order to participate in a grant round:&#x20;

1\. Create Your Grant on builder.gitcoin.co

2\. [Apply to the specific Grant Round](https://support.gitcoin.co/gitcoin-knowledge-base/gitcoin-grants-program/project-owners/how-to-apply-to-a-round-in-explorer) you wish to participate in

#### Here you will find a step-by-step guide on #1 which is how to create your grant on builder.

1. **Connect your wallet.** Go to[ builder.gitcoin.co](https://builder.gitcoin.co/), and click on “Connect Wallet.” If you don’t have a wallet set up already, click on “Get a Wallet” to set up your wallet, or “Learn More” to learn more about wallets.

**Note**: If you have multiple team members, ensure that the person most likely to update your proposal is the one submitting your project. Only one person will have access to editing your project on Builder.
