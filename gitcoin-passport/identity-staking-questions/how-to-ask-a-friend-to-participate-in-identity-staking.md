# How to ask a friend to participate in Identity Staking

### EMAIL

#### Subject: Let's Boost Our Web3 Reputations with GTC Staking 🌟

Hey \[Friend's Name],

Hope you're well! I recently stumbled upon a great way to enhance our web3 reputations—GTC Staking via Gitcoin Passport.

The idea is simple: we stake GTC tokens on each other's identities, boosting our Unique Humanity Scores on Gitcoin. This not only elevates our web3 standing but also helps Gitcoin in anti-fraud measures.

For more details on how this works and what credentials we can earn, check out this[ support documentation](https://support.gitcoin.co/gitcoin-knowledge-base/gitcoin-passport/identity-staking-questions).

I plan to stake some GTC on your identity and would be thrilled if you'd consider reciprocating. This mutual action allows us both to earn new credentials and enhances our reputations.

🚀 Interested? If you're up for it, please share the Ethereum address associated with your Gitcoin Passport so we can get started.

Best,\
\[Your Name]
