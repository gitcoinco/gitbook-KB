#### The future for Gitcoin is multi-mechanism

Quadratic Funding (QF) has empowered hundreds communities to reach equitable consensus on how funding should be allocated, and it remains a pillar for public funding. However, every funding round has unique needs, and new options have begun to turn heads as attractive alternatives to QF.

Exciting developments in the public funding space have produced Retroactive funding, Minimal Anti-Collusion Infrastructure (MACI), and more. These novel approaches have found traction enabling new use-cases and improving incentives alignment for funding recipients.
