## How It Works

Passport's zkSync stamp provides a nuanced reflection of user engagement on the zkSync Era by assessing a variety of activities. This enhancement is geared towards offering a holistic view of an individual's participation within the ecosystem. The zkSync stamp is divided into two main sections:

1. **Engagement Levels in Zksync Era: This categorizes users into tiered levels such as:**
   * **Engagement Explorer:** For users who are actively exploring various features of zkSync Era.
   * **L2 Believer:** For users who regularly transact and demonstrate reliance on the zkSync Era platform.
   * **zkSync Champion:** For leading users who significantly contribute to and influence the zkSync community.
2. **Transactional Verification:**
   * **Verified Transactor:** Recognizes users whose transactions on zkSync Era have achieved verified status, confirming their active participation and trust in the platform.

Each Engagement Level credential, indicating the user's activity depth on the network, has an associated score of 1.67, and the score is cumulative with each tier attained. This structured approach ensures that the stamp accurately mirrors the dynamic and evolving nature of user interaction on zkSync Era.
