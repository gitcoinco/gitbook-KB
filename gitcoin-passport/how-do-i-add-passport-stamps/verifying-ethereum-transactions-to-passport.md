## How Does it Work

The Gitcoin Passport's Ethereum stamp provides a nuanced reflection of user engagement on the Ethereum mainnet by assessing a variety of activities. This enhancement is geared towards offering a holistic view of an individual's participation within the ecosystem. The Ethereum stamp is divided into two main sections:

1. **Engagement Milestones:** This categorizes users into tiered levels such as:
   * **ETH Enthusiast:** Showcases initial engagement and support for the Ethereum ecosystem.
   * **ETH Advocate:** Represents a higher level of commitment and activity
   * **ETH Maxi:** Denotes exceptional involvement and dedication.&#x20;
2. **Your Ethereum Activity Metrics:**
   * **Spend more than 0.25 ETH on gas:** Highlights significant financial engagement with the network.
   * **Execute over 100 transactions:** Indicates a robust level of transactional activity.
   * **Active on over 50 distinct days:** Showcases sustained interaction with Ethereum.

The combination of these stamps indicate the user's activity depth on the network. This structured approach ensures that the stamp accurately mirrors the dynamic and evolving nature of user interaction on Ethereum.
