After confirming that you have the required NFTs, follow these steps to claim the stamp

1. Go to [https://passport.gitcoin.co/](https://passport.gitcoin.co/) and "Sign in with Ethereum" to access your dashboard.
2. Click Connect on the NFT Holder stamp card.
3. Click the checkbox for the NFT Holder credential then click Verify.
4. Confirm your account is now verified. You can confirm this by seeing the button that previously read as ‚ÄúConnect‚Äù will now say Verified. Alternatively, [you can inspect the Passport JSON.‚Äã](https://support.gitcoin.co/gitcoin-knowledge-base/gitcoin-passport/common-questions/how-to-access-your-passport-json)

### FAQ:

* **I have an NFT but I‚Äôm unable to claim the stamp?**\
  Please verify that your NFT is an ERC-721 like in the image above. You can verify by going to [etherscan](https://etherscan.io/), putting in your address and clicking on token holdings. If you have an ERC-721 NFT and you still cannot claim the stamp, please reach out to our Support team
* **I have an ENS. Why doesn‚Äôt that count?**\
  You need to confirm that your Ethereum Name Service NFT is an ERC-721. The new Name Wrapped NFT is now an ERC-1155 and not ERC-721
* **Why did I successfully claim the stamp but the score was not added?**\
  If your NFT was transferred from another user who had previously claimed the NFT Holder Passport stamp with that same NFT, you might not see your Passport score updated even though you successfully verified the stamp. You will only get the score for it once the stamp has expired from the previous owner‚Äôs wallet [after the 90 day expiration period](https://support.gitcoin.co/gitcoin-knowledge-base/gitcoin-passport/common-questions/why-have-my-stamps-expired).
