# ðŸŒ¿ Transition to Allo v2: Explorer Guide

#### What is Allo v2?

Grants Stack is currently built on top of the [Allo protocol](https://docs.allo.gitcoin.co/#current-status), a set of smart contracts that enable the democratic allocation and distribution of capital, and Allo v2 is the latest version of the protocol. With the transition to Allo v2, we are excited to improve overall user experience, enable experimentation of modular and flexible funding mechanisms, and empower developers to easily contribute to the protocol to build new community funding experiences.
