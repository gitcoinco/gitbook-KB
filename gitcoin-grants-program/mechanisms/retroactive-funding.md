# Retroactive Funding



> The core principle behind the concept of retroactive public goods funding is simple: **itâ€™s easier to agree on what **_**was**_** useful than what **_**will be**_** useful**. - [Vitalik Buterin](https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/retroactive-public-goods-funding-33c9b7d00f0c)

Differing from other mechanisms, retroactive funding is based on _past_ performance. This can be a great way to support builders in a community that have made already useful contributions.
