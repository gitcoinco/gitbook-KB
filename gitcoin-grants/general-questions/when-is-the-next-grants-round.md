description: Major changes to the Gitcoin quarterly Grants Rounds program

# 📚 When is the next Grants Round?

Historically, the Gitcoin Grants Rounds operate on a quarterly cadence. [Governance](https://gov.gitcoin.co/)  approved the decision to sunset centralized grants (cGrants) and transition to the [Gitcoin Grants Stack](../../gitcoin-grants-program/what-is-gitcoin-grants-stack.md).&#x20;

We began this transition by introducing the [Alpha Test Season](https://go.gitcoin.co/blog/announcing-the-gitcoin-alpha-tests) late 2022, where we began testing our new protocol with partner rounds and a Gitcoin-managed round. Sticking with our quarterly cadence, we have entered the Beta phase of testing.&#x20;
