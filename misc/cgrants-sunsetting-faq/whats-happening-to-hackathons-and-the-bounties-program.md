# What’s happening to Hackathons and the Bounties program?

For years Gitcoin has been known for it’s hackathons and bounties program. Moving forward, this part of Gitcoin’s business will be taken over by [Buidlbox](https://buidlbox.io/), giving space for Gitcoin to focus on it’s Gitcoin Grants Program and [suite of products](https://twitter.com/gitcoin/status/1670892624008364032).

The same hackathons and bounties programs you’ve come to benefit from and enjoy can still be access through [Buidlbox](https://buidlbox.io/).
