# 📃 How to apply to a round in Explorer

Once there, you can see all the active rounds. This includes the ones that are live and accepting donations, and the ones that are just in the application phase.

If you don’t see the round you’re looking for on the home page, select ‘Explore Rounds’ and using the filter option on the right hand side, select ‘taking applications’.

Step 4: Once you are happy with your application, click “Submit,” which will open your connected wallet. A prompt will follow to sign the transaction, and you will need to pay the necessary gas fee to apply.
