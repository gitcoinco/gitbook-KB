# Passport Custom Scorer

Grants Stack proudly leverages Gitcoin Passport to allow you to collect "stamps" that prove your humanity and reputation. This is crucial for maintaining the integrity and security of quadratic funding which allocates matching funds to projects in a democratic way. By using Passport, we ensure a reliable and secure way for you to prove your humanity while protecting your privacy every step of the way. Proving your humanity with Passport will unlock opportunities for you to qualify for donation matching for projects you support on Grants Stack.&#x20;

Gitcoin allows communities to give higher priority to specific Stamps they find particularly significant.
