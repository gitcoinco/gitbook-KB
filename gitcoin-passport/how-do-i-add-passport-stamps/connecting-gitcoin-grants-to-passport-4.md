## How Does it Work

A qualifying Gitcoin Grants round is an official fundraising event led by Gitcoin, where community contributions are pooled and matched to bolster the curated projects. Please note that while there may be other donation programs or rounds facilitated by various communities using the Gitcoin Grants platform, only those officially funded and conducted by Gitcoin qualify for the Gitcoin Grants stamp.&#x20;

Your donations during these official Gitcoin-funded rounds are what will count towards the stamp issuance. We recognize the importance of your contributions and are here to guide you through the process of obtaining recognition for your support. Should you have any uncertainties or require further clarification on the eligibility criteria, our support team is readily available to assist you.

**NOTE**: After donating, you must manually claim your Gitcoin Grants stamp in your Gitcoin Passport.
