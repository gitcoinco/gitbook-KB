# ðŸ”Œ Guide to Add Idena Stamp to Passport

Idena is a groundbreaking network where every user proves they are a real individual without revealing personal information, through a unique process known as "Proof of Person." At the heart of Idena is a fascinating concept: all users participate in a simultaneous test, known as a "validation ceremony," which occurs at regular intervals. This collective intelligence test requires users to solve puzzles that are easy for humans but hard for bots, ensuring that each account is controlled by a unique human. This method positions Idena as a powerful tool for authenticating real human presence online, making it an invaluable identity verification signal for services like Gitcoin Passport. By connecting your Idena account to Gitcoin Passport, you strengthen your digital presence, assuring the community and platforms that you are a verified individual. This guide simplifies the process for connecting your Idena account with Gitcoin Passport.
