# What are Gitcoin Grants ?

Gitcoin Grants is an experiment where people can fund their open source projects for public benefit with QF (Quadratic Funding) matching contributions from Gitcoin’s QF Fund sponsored by donors in the Ethereum ecosystem.

Gitcoin, with the support of the Ethereum Foundation and other matching partners — to run at least quarterly rounds in 2020, with a planned 4 QF rounds. The hope is that the regularly scheduled rounds will help grantees use these funds not only as additional donations, but as a strong source of funding for their operations in the Ethereum community.

* Round 9: 3/10/21 - 3/25/21
* Round 10: 6/16/21 - 7/1/21
* Round 11: 9/8/2021 - 9/23/21
* Round 12: 12/1/2021 - 12/15/21
