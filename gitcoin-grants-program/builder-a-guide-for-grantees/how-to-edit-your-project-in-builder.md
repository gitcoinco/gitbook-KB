# ✏️ How to edit your project in Builder

To edit your project on Builder, visit [builder.gitcoin.co](https://builder.gitcoin.co/).

Step 1: Once you’re in your Builder dashboard, you will see a list of your active projects. Click on the one you’d like to edit:

It will take you through the same flow as when you created your project (_see_ [_How to Create a Project in Builder_](https://support.gitcoin.co/gitcoin-knowledge-base/gitcoin-grants-protocol/how-to-create-a-project-in-grants-hub)).

Step 3: Make all the necessary changes, by clicking “Next,” and finalize by clicking “Save and Publish.”

After editing your project you must reapply to the round you desire to participate in.&#x20;

_**Note:** each time you edit and “Save and Publish,” you will have to pay gas fees because creating/editing a project is an on-chain transaction._ \
