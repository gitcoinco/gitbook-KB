# ðŸ¤” How do I unlink a Passport from my Gitcoin account?

_This is unfortunately not possible yet._ However, you could overwrite your submitted Passport by resubmitting a distinct empty (no stamps and data points) Passport, for example.

### Still not working?

If you aren't able to unlink your Passport manually, you can email Gitcoin support at [support@passport.xyz](mailto:support@passport.xyz) .

#### The information we require

In your email to [support@passport.xyz](mailto:support@passport.xyz), please include the following information:

* Your **Gitcoin** username
* The email associated with your **GitHub** account
* The wallet address

_Requests without the required information may take a long time to process due to the volume of enquiries we receive._
