# 🤔 What is our Quid Pro Quo Policy?

#### Quid Pro Quo is Latin for ‘Something for Something.’ At Gitcoin, it means providing a reward to donors for contributing to a particular project. This can result in the project being removed from the matching distribution and the funding round.&#x20;

### Why does this policy exist?&#x20;

We are committed to maintaining the integrity of Quadratic Funding mechanisms. Quadratic Funding is designed to amplify the impact of community contributions to projects they value, based on the principle that individuals contribute because they appreciate the project's potential outcomes. However, this goal is threatened by the emergence of external incentives that distort the intended purpose of these contributions.

Side-incentives, or motivations external to the project's objectives distort contribution behaviors. This distortion arises when contributors are motivated more by personal gains than by the success of the projects they support, undermining the quadratic funding model. Furthermore, the nuanced nature of motivations and the timing of rewards, such as airdrops after contributions, complicate efforts to police behavior and ensure fairness.

Our goal is to foster an environment where contributions are motivated by a genuine interest in the success of community-valued projects.&#x20;

#### It is not allowed to reward a donor for their contributions to specific project(s). This means the following are not allowed:

* Exclusive Invitations to events, meetings, or spaces for donors to specific projects
* Personalized Rewards or Services, such as consulting or coaching, in exchange for donations
* Gas Fee Reimbursements for donating to particular projects

#### It is however valuable to encourage broad participation without undermining the principle of impartial support. The following are allowed:

* General Acknowledgments that thank all donors to a round or cause
* Open Invitations to community events that welcome all donors, regardless of the projects they have supported
* Community Badges that recognize participation in the funding round as a whole
