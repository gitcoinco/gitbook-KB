# ðŸ’¡ How to add round operators to your round?

In the Grants Manager(manager.gitcoin.co), we have introduced a new tab called "Manage Team" to help you efficiently manage your grants round team. This tab allows you to view and distinguish between admins and operators. Admins have the ability to add other round operators, while operators have the same capabilities as admins, except for the power to add new round operators.

To add a round operator to your grants round, follow these simple steps:

1.  Navigate to the "Manage Team" tab in your Grants Manager.\

5. After entering the wallet address, click on the "Add Member" button.
6. The system will process your request and add the specified wallet address as a round operator for your grants round.

Once the round operator has been successfully added, they will have access to the same features and capabilities as an admin, allowing them to effectively manage the grants round. However, it's important to note that round operators cannot add new round operators themselves â€“ this privilege remains with the admin(s).

By utilizing the "Manage Team" tab and following these steps, you can easily expand your grants round team and collaborate with trusted round operators to streamline your grants management process.
