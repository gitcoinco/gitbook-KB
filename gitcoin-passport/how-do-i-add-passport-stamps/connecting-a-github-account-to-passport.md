# ðŸ”Œ Guide to Add GitHub account to Passport

Integrating your GitHub account with your Gitcoin Passport not only demonstrates your coding prowess but also enhances your visibility and credibility within the Gitcoin ecosystem. This guide will navigate you through the process of verifying your GitHub account, detailing the steps to connect and the prerequisites needed for a successful integration.

**Cost:** Free ($0)

**Time:** 5 minutes

**Validity:** 90 days&#x20;

## Prerequisites

* A Github account. If you don't already have one, you can create one at [github](https://github.com).
  * For the Contribution Activity Stamp, you should have made github contributions on at least 30 distinct days. NOTE: Only contributions within the last 3 years are considered for this stamp.

## How to verify your Github account

1. Go to [https://passport.gitcoin.co/](https://passport.gitcoin.co/) and "Sign in with Ethereum" to access your dashboard.
2. Click Connect on the Github stamp card.
3. Click the checkbox for the credential you want to claim then click Verify.
4. You might get redirected to a popup window and prompted to:
   * Sign in to the Github account that you want to connect
   * Confirm the data that you will share with the Passport project
   * After confirmation the popup window should close and you will be redirected to the Passport app
5. Return to the passport browser window and confirm your account is now verified. You can confirm this by seeing the button that previously read as Connect Account will now say Verified. Alternatively, [you can inspect the Passport JSON.â€‹](https://support.gitcoin.co/gitcoin-knowledge-base/gitcoin-passport/common-questions/how-to-access-your-passport-json)

You can verify your contribution activity by going to your github profile [https://github.com/{username](https://github.com/%7Busername)} where you will see your contribution history. Please note that weâ€™re looking at the number of distinct days where you contributed, not your total number of contributions.

### FAQ:

* **Why did I successfully claim the stamp but the score was not added?**\
  When attempting to claim a stamp using more than one wallet address, the score associated with subsequent wallet addresses will not be added. It can happen if you already verified the same Github account on a different Passport wallet. In order to obtain points in a different wallet, you will have to wait for the verified stamp to expire. Each stamp has a 90-day expiration. See[ here](https://support.gitcoin.co/gitcoin-knowledge-base/gitcoin-passport/common-questions/why-is-my-passport-score-not-adding-up) for more information.
* **I have contributions from a long time ago but I cannot claim the stamp**\
  Only contributions within the last 3 years are counted towards a Github stamp.&#x20;
